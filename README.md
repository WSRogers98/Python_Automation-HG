Due to some automation scripts containing proprietarymmethods used by Healthgrades, some code and files have been omitted from this Github repository.

This repository contains a GUI and some automation scripts that I created for the use of the Healthgrades quality assurance team to use in their DevOps process. these scripts automated several aspects of QA process such as Information validation, SEM marketing and webcrawling.
